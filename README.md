# PowerBI_HR-analytics-case-study
In this Power BI case study, we will import, analyze and visualize Human Resources data in Power BI. We’ll carry out exploratory data analysis and 
will use DAX to help build powerful visualizations. We’ll finish our analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. 
This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees. 
We’ll finalize the case study by making design changes to our report that provides a clean, branded design.
